      Among Lines does not keep private information like your password. 
      In fact Dan has worked very hard to ensure that we don't ever see your password even a little. Not a peak. 
      That being said, we do see your scorecard and as the creators of Among Lines, we retain the right to point and 
      laugh at how badly you've done, as well as show our friends, family and collegues.
      By agreeing to our terms and conditions, you forfeit your right to wallow in misery at your last competition alone, 
      safe in the knowledge that nobody else will know about it. As well, you forfeit custody of all well scoring arrows, 
      favorite finger tabs, gently used targets, first born children, and stray pencils to Among Lines creators and staff.
